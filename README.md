# ShinyApp

The purpose of the application is to look at particular aspects of your favorite artists' music through some of Spotify's insights: valence, danceability and energy! We have shown a plot and a table of data to-date at time of selection.

Users can learn about any artists' discography through the search bar and even filter for a specific album with the second search bar if they so choose. All selections will be  made on the first page while the tabs at the top of the app will allow users to browse between the different types of insights. Be patient as it may take some time for selections to load.

Each insight page will display its respective plot, range (where you can hover to get specific values), and table. The last page lets users look at relationship between certain insights.
